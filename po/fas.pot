"FAS is designed around an open architecture.  Unlike the traditional "
"account systems where a single admin or group of admins decide who gets "
"to be in what group, FAS is completely designed to be self operating per "
"team.  Every group is given at least one administrator who can then "
"approve other people in the group.  Also, unlike traditional account "
"systems.  FAS allows people to apply for the groups they want to be in.  "
"This paridigm is interesting as it allows anyone to find out who is in "
"what groups and contact them.  This openness is brought over from the "
"same philosophies that make Open Source popular."

"People shouldn't assume that by applying for a group that they're then in"

"time.  For best odds of success, learn about the group you're applying "
"for and get to know someone in the group.  Find someone with sponsor or "
"admin access and ask them if they'd have time to mentor you.  Plan on "
"spending at least a few days learning about the group, doing a mundane "
"task, participating on the mailing list.  Sometimes this process can take"

"system goes the disctinction is easy.  Sponsors can approve new users and"
" make people into sponsors.  They cannot, however, downgrade or remove "
